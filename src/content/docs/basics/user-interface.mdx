FlowMark’s UI is made up of three main sections.

- Sidebar: The sidebar on the left displays the folder tree and allows you to manage notes hierarchically.
- Note List: Next to the sidebar, you can see a list of Markdown notes in the selected folder for quick access.
- Editor: On the right side of the screen, there is a Markdown editor for editing the selected note, with real-time preview support.

## Create a New Folder

Click the “New Folder” button at the top of the sidebar to create a new folder inside the currently selected folder. This helps you organize your notes in more detail.
You can also double-click a folder to move through folder levels like breadcrumbs.
