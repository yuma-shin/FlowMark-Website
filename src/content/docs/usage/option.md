In FlowMark, you can change the language and theme.

## Change the Language

FlowMark detects your system language and automatically sets the default language.  
You can change the language setting from the globe icon in the top-right corner.

## Change the Theme

FlowMark provides separate themes for light and dark modes.  
You can switch them from the sun (light), moon (dark), and monitor (system) icons in the top-right corner, based on your preference.  
By default, it is automatically set to the system theme.
