Notyra’s UI consists of three main sections.

- Sidebar: The sidebar on the left displays the folder tree and lets you manage notes hierarchically.
- Note List: Next to the sidebar, a list of Markdown notes in the selected folder is shown for easy access.
- Editor: On the right side of the screen, a Markdown editor is provided for editing the selected note, with real-time preview support.

## Create a New Folder

Click the “New Folder” button at the top of the sidebar to create a new folder inside the currently selected folder. This helps you organize your notes in more detail.  
Double-click a folder to navigate through the folder hierarchy like breadcrumbs.

## Create a Note

Click the “New Note” button at the top of the note list to create a new Markdown note inside the currently selected folder. This allows you to start editing a new note right away.  
If you create a note while viewing a specific folder, the note will be created in that folder.  
Click a note to open it in the editor and start editing.
